## Usage

```
docker run -dit --name cray1 \
           -p 2222:22 \
           rattydave/cray1:latest
```

## Auto Update

To automatically update I recomend using watchtower.

```
docker run -d \
  --name watchtower \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  v2tec/watchtower 
```

## Access

### Connection Method 1

To get the IP address of the running container.
```
docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' cray1
```
To access the terminal screens either connect via SSH to port 2222 of the running container.

- Username : root
- Password : root

then when you have the prompt

```
tmux attach
```

### Connection Method 2

From the host machine:

```
docker exec -it cray1 tmux attach
```

### Usage

Once in you are presented with tmux running 4 windows.

- 0:cray_xmp_sim* 
- 20003:telnet  
- 20004:telnet  
- 20006:telnet

To ease in the debugging each window has the identification the same as the connection port. 

To switch between screens press ```CTRL-b``` then ```n```. More information on tmux at https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/

Switch to the window 20003:telent

The status line should say 

IOP-0 KERNEL, VERSION 4.2.2,  Sn302/25, * Leading Edge *

Type ```START @DK0:COS_117 @DK0:INSTALL``` then press ```ENTER```

you should see 

```
MFINIT: COMPLETE
CPU <-> MIOP CHANNEL INIT
CPU <-> MIOP LINKAGE COMPLETE
START COMPLETE 
Concentrator ordinal 3  initialized
Concentrator ordinal 3  processed LOGON from ID FE
```

Next type ```STATION``` This will start a new terminal on 20000 and switch to it automatically.

The top bar should say ```CRAY STATION.  VERSION 4.2.2, IOS.```

On this terminal type ```LOGON``` you should see ```COS 1.17  02/28/89```

To get a list of commands type ```HELP``` and you can change frames by using ```+``` or ```-```.
